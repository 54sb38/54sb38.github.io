# What do you need to do

Thank you for participating in my test!

As you might know, a great challenge of workout is to lose motivation and drop out of the plan. 
The purpose of this study is to discover how effective Jack, a (simulated) digital human fitness trainer, 
can motivate you to stick to your regular workout routine. 

Before you start, you should have already consented to participating in this study by:
1. Read the [participation information sheet](https://github.com/54sb38/54sb38.github.io/blob/master/assets/Participant%20Information%20Sheet%20-%20Jingbo%20Ma.pdf).
2. Declared that you are capable of carrying out regular physical activities by signing the [health screening table](https://github.com/54sb38/54sb38.github.io/blob/master/assets/Adult-Pre-Screening-Tool-2021-3.pdf).
3. Signing the [consent form](https://github.com/54sb38/54sb38.github.io/blob/master/assets/Consent%20form%20-%20Jingbo.pdf).

Please send the signed documents to jingbo.ma@uq.net.au

Note that although the consent form mentioned Strava, we do not need it at all. There was a change of plan.

Once you have completed signing the forms, you can start testing. The tasks are simple:
1.	Complete the [pre-test survey](https://forms.gle/W8H7iQWk8W1c4wwi6).
2.	Download [Testflight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) from Appstore.
3.	Download the actual app that you will test, [Jack](https://testflight.apple.com/join/15NWcw85)
4.	Use the app for 7 days, in whichever way you want. Jack will send a notification everyday at 7pm, reminding you to have a chat with him. 
5.	After 7 days, fill in the post-test survey. I will contact you on day 7 and send you the link.

**The $20 gift voucher is expected to be sent to you in the week 13 of UQ calendar.**
